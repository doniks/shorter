So you want to hack on Shorter? Awesome! Do the following:

Connect your Ubuntu Touch device with an USB cable and then on the console execute

```
git clone https://github.com/doniks/shorter
cd shorter 
clickable
```

This should retrieve the source code, build it, install it on the device and run the application. 

I'm happy to receive your contribution, just get in touch on github!
